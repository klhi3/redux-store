# Redux Store

React’s Context API : Flux or MobX
e-commerce platform code

## Features

This e-commerce platform uses Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API and this website's state management is out of the React ecosystem.

The app passes reducers to a Redux store, extracts state data from the store, and  dispatches actions using Redux instead of the Context API
